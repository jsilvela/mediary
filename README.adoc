Mediary is a tool to write and store events into a machine-readable format.

== Overview
Events have three attributes: time, tags, text.

== Details
Concept version coded in +go+ (this is my first program). Uses JSON for storage.
Currently very much a CLI, but eventually would be nice to have this in iOS.
